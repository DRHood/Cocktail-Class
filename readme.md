**Cocktail Class**

The Cocktail Class redevelopment is aimed at providing an in-depth training environmet for bartenders, with a comprehensive database of recipes, ingredients, and techniques. For the purpose of demonstrating techniques, there will also be vivid animations, rather than the usual poorly shot training videos. It will also contain features from the original project, such as quick reference, ability to submit additions, alternates, and edits.
